Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is 1.



Example 1:


Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Example 2:


Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]


Constraints:

m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 104
1 <= m * n <= 104
mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
There is at least one 0 in mat.
